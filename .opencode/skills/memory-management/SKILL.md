# Memory Management

## Initial creation

When creating initial project memories (`.serena/memories/` is empty), after writing all memories, stage them with `git add -A` and commit with message `"chore: initialize project memories"`.

After completing meaningful project changes (new features, refactors, config changes, dependency updates), update relevant Serena memories to reflect the new state. Do not update for trivial or one-off changes.

- `mem:core` — update if project purpose, structure, or key invariants changed
- `mem:tech_stack` — update if languages, tooling, or dependencies changed
- `mem:conventions` — update if new conventions were established
- `mem:suggested_commands` — update if custom commands or workflows changed
- `mem:task_completion` — update if verification steps changed

Create new memories for uncovered domains (e.g., `mem:architecture`, `mem:deployment`, `mem:testing`). Use topic folders to group related memories.

## Discovery model

- Progressive discovery through references, building a graph of memories.
- Agents are provided with the list of all memory names at startup.
- `mem:core` is the top-level entry point (graph root). It should reference other memories covering major domains, which in turn reference more specific ones.
- Use topics/folders to group related memories (e.g., `frontend/core`, `backend/debugging`).
- References use `mem:` prefix inside backticks: `` `mem:frontend/core` ``.
- Surrounding text should clearly indicate what the referenced memory covers.
- Memories themselves should not contain "when to read" information.

## Style

Dense agent notes, not prose docs. Prefer invariants, terse bullets. Avoid obvious context, rationale, and examples unless they prevent likely mistakes. Keep guidance durable and generalizable, not task-local.

## Add/update threshold

Only add or update memories with stable, non-obvious project conventions that avoid complex rediscovery. Do not add: quick-read facts; generic language/framework knowledge; one-off task notes; volatile line-level details; behavior likely to change soon.

## Maintenance actions

- Renaming memories: references update automatically via Serena's `rename_memory` tool.
- Checking for stale memories: call `serena memories check`.
